# ðŸŽ® Inventory Min Finder (MinimumElementChallenge - Game Edition)

This is a fun, interactive Java console program that simulates a basic **video game inventory system**, where each item in the player's backpack has a **weight**. The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of **arrays, loops, and user input**, but in a way that's easier to relate to than the original classroom-style example.

## ðŸ§  Challenge Description (Remixed from "MinimumElementChallenge")

**Original Concept:**
- Get an array of integers from user input
- Print the array
- Find the smallest value in the array
- Print that smallest value

**Remixed Game Version:**
> You're developing a simple inventory weight-checking system for a video game. Each item has a weight. Your program will:

1. Ask the player how many items theyâ€™re carrying  
2. Let the player enter the weight of each item  
3. Display the full list of item weights  
4. Identify and display the **lightest item** in the inventory

## ðŸ›  Features & Concepts Demonstrated

### âœ… Arrays
- An array is used to store the weights entered by the player
- Input size is dynamic â€” the player chooses how many items theyâ€™re carrying

### âœ… User Input
- `Scanner` is used to read values from the console
- Numbers are entered one-by-one for full control and clarity

### âœ… Looping
- A `for` loop fills the array based on how many items the player is carrying
- Another `for` loop is used to find the minimum weight by comparing each item

### âœ… Simple Algorithm
- The program uses a basic linear search (starting from index 0) to find the smallest number in the array
